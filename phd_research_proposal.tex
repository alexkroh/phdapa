%\section{Introduction}

Safety critical embedded systems require a thorough analysis of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET)
to ensure adherence to strict deadlines. Performance enhancement features of modern
CPUs and cache warmth lead to non-determinism in execution time. For this reason, the WCET estimate
is pessimistic and leads to a dramatic underutilisation of processing resources.

%\section{Method}
Hardware accelleration of the core software architecture can not only improve the WCET, but it may
also reduce the degree of pessimism in the estimated value and hence improve processor utilisation.

With limited FPGA area, it would not be feasible to consider an enire software system as a candidate
for hardware accelleration. The focus is hence limited to the accelleration of an Operating System (OS)
micro kernel. The micro kernel software architecture traditionally provides a minimal set of core
features while user level tasks are expected to provide OS services and driver support.

The most frequent kernel invocations in a static system are caused by the scheduler and Inter Process
Communication (IPC). We plan to begin the research by analysing the WCET benefits of accellerating these
features in programmable logic. With positive results, we plan to extend the scope of research to dynamic
systems where resource creation and distruction must also be considered in the WCET estimate.
\\

%\section{Outcomes}
We can expect success in this research to reduce the monetary and energy costs of a critical system by
allowing the system designer to scale back on the provisioned processing power. This research will also
seed new research opportunities in the application of programmable logic to micro-kernel architectures.
