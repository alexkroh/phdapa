\section{Introduction}

Safety critical embedded systems require a thorough analysis of Worst Case Execution Time (WCET)
to ensure adherence to strict safety deadlines. Performance enhancement features of modern
CPUs and cache warmth lead to non-determinism in execution time. For this reason, the WCET estimate
is pessimistic and leads to a dramatic underutilisation of processing resources.
